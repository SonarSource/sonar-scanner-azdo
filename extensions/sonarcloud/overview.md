**[SonarCloud][sc]** is the leading online service for Code Quality & Security. It is totally free for open-source projects, and supports all major programming languages including C#, VB .Net, JavaScript, TypeScript, C/C++ and many more. If your code is closed source, SonarCloud also offers a paid plan to run private analyses.

This Azure DevOps extension provides build tasks that you can add in your build definition. You'll benefit from automated detection of bugs and vulnerabilities across all branches and Pull Requests. SonarCloud explains all coding issues in details, giving you chance to fix your code before even merging and deploying, all the while learning best practices along the way. At project level, you'll also get a dedicated widget that tracks the overall health of your application.

To get started in a few minutes, you can :

- Follow this dedicated [Microsoft Lab][getstarted]
- Follow the SonarCloud walkthrough in this Microsoft Learning Module: [Scan code for vulnerabilities in Azure Pipelines][msft_learn].
- Benefit from embedded templates for common analyses :
  - **Classic** build pipelines templates integrated while creating a new pipeline
  - **YAML** build pipeline templates available in our Sourcecode : https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanner-vsts/tree/master/yaml-pipeline-templates
- Benefit from a bunch of sample projects (using different build technologies), analyzed on SonarCloud, with their **YAML** pipelines files (See the SonarCloud badge on the README.md file for a link to SonarCloud project)
  - [.NET Framework](https://dev.azure.com/sonarsource/DotNetTeam%20Project/_git/sample-dotnet-framework-project)
  - [.NET Core](https://dev.azure.com/sonarsource/DotNetTeam%20Project/_git/sample-dotnet-core-project)
  - [C++](https://dev.azure.com/sonarsource/DotNetTeam%20Project/_git/sample-cpp-project)
  - [Gradle](https://dev.azure.com/sonarsource/DotNetTeam%20Project/_git/sample-gradle-project)
  - [Maven](https://dev.azure.com/sonarsource/DotNetTeam%20Project/_git/sample-maven-project)

## About the SonarCloud Azure DevOps Marketplace Extension

This extension provides the following features:

- A dedicated **SonarCloud EndPoint** to set the user token and validate the connection.
- Three build tasks (along with build templates) to get your projects analyzed easily:
  - **Prepare Analysis Configuration** task, to configure all the required settings before executing the build. This task is mandatory. In case of .NET solutions or Java projects, this tasks helps to integrate seamlessly with MSBuild, Maven and Gradle tasks.
  - **Run Code Analysis** task, to actually execute the analysis of the source code. Not required for Maven or Gradle projects.
  - **Publish Quality Gate Result** task, to display the quality gate status in the build summary. This tasks is optional, as it can increase the overall build time.
- Analysis of the branches and the **pull requests** of your projects
- A **widget** to monitor the quality gate for your projects on your favorite dashboard
- A **deployment gate (in preview)** allowing you to control your deployment process by checking the status of the Quality Gate of the last build related to the release pipeline executed.

Note that the above features are **available for all Git repository providers in Azure DevOps**: Azure Repos Git, Bitbucket Cloud or GitHub.

## Highlighted Features

### Seamless Integration with .Net solutions

The analysis of C# and VB. Net solution is really straightforward since it only requires adding the two **Prepare Analysis Configuration** and **Run Code Analysis** tasks to your build definition.

### Easy setup for Maven and Gradle projects

If you're doing Java, analyzing your source code is also very easy. It only requires adding the **Prepare Analysis Configuration** task, and check the **Run SonarCloud Analysis** option in the "Code Analysis" panel of the Maven or Gradle task.

### Branch and Pull Request analysis

Whatever type of source repository you are analysing, when a build is run on a branch of your project, the extension automatically configures the analysis to be pushed to the relevant project branch on SonarCloud:

![Branches](img/branches.png)

If you configure your build definition as a build validation for pull requests of that project (this can be done on "Branch policies"), SonarCloud will also analyze the code changes and decorate the pull request with comments and overall status so that you can merge with confidence:

![PR-Decoration](img/pull-request-decoration.png)

**Important note**: to activate pull request decoration, you must specify a user token in the "General Settings > Pull Requests" administration page of your project in SonarCloud.

### Quality Gate Status

#### In a dashboard widget

You can monitor the quality gate status of your projects in your favorite dashboard:

![Quality Gate Widget](img/widget.png)

#### In Release Pipelines (Preview)

You can check the quality gate status of a build as a pre-deployment gate in release pipelines.

#### In the build summary

The **Publish Quality Gate Result** task waits for the analysis report to be consumed by the SonarCloud in order to flag the build job with the Quality Gate status. The Quality Gate is a major, out-of-the-box, feature of SonarCloud. It provides the ability to know at each analysis whether an application passes or fails the release criteria. In other words it tells you at every analysis whether an application is ready for production "quality-wise".

Example of a passing Quality Gate:

Example of a failing Quality Gate:
